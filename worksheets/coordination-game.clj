;;; ## A mutually recursive model
;;; 
;;; Now, suppose Amy and Bob are a bit more clever about it. Rather than choosing independently at random, they each choose by simulating what they think the other would do.
;;; 
;;; We do this by defining mutually recursive functions for sampling the location of Amy and Bob, conditioned on what they each think the other is thinking. Roughly:
;;; 
;;; * Amy wants to go where Bob goes
;;; * Amy knows Bob wants to go where Amy goes
;;; * Amy knows Bob knows that Amy wants to go where Bob goes
;;; 
;;; and so on. This recursion would continue indefinitely, so we add a `depth` parameter explicitly limiting the amount of meta-reasoning which takes place.
;;; 
;;; In the base case of the recursion, one of the actors (here, Bob) eventually chooses to simply pick a location.
;;; 
;;; The behaviour of the two actors are defined in the Anglican functions `amy` and `bob`, which each call one another, and return a location. We use the same reparameterization trick as above to specify our model in a way which avoids conditioning on hard constraints.
